## Pricing Strategy

### Current Model
- **Platform fee:** 2% of bounty amount
- **Judge rewards:** 50% of fee (1% of bounty)
- **Treasury:** 50% of fee (1% of bounty)

**Example:** $10,000 bounty
- Worker receives: $9,800
- Judges share: $100 (1%)
- Treasury: $100 (1%)

### Competitive Comparison
| Platform | Fee | Verification Time | Approach |
|----------|-----|-------------------|----------|
| ClawJudge | 2% | 48-72 hours | Automated + Judge panel |
| Immunefi | 10% | 2-4 weeks | Manual audit committee |
| Sherlock | 10% | 1-2 weeks | Hybrid (some automated) |
| Code4rena | 10% | 2-4 weeks | Manual audit |

**Pricing Power:** Even at 5% fee, ClawJudge would be 2x cheaper and 5x faster than competitors.
